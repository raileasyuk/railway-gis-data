# Railway GIS data

This combines GIS data from various sources to create a "good enough", simplified representation of the GB railway network for **public-facing applications**.

> This is a work-in-progress, and does not yet represent the full GB railway network.

## Usage

Import the geopackage (`rail-map/merged.gpkg`) into your favourite GIS software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS Pro), and start exploring!
